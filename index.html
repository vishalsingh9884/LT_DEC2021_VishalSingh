        <h1 align="center"> What is coding?</h1>

        Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a
        computer
        what
        actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can
        tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites
        and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.
        <br>
        Computers are amazing, but they can’t think for themselves (yet!). They require people to give them
        instructions. Coding is a list of step-by-step instructions that get computers to do what you want them to do.
        Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites.
        <br>
        Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer. When
        children learn to code, it helps them to develop essential skills such as problem solving, logic and critical
        thinking. Through coding, children can learn that there’s often more than one way to solve a problem, and that
        simpler and more efficient solutions are often better. Learning to code encourages children to become creators,
        not just consumers, of the technology they use.
        <br>
        While learning to code at the primary school level, children are encouraged to think critically and
        strategically to solve problems—often simple puzzles like getting an onscreen character to move around a maze.
        For younger children, visual blocks are often used to represent programming concepts and terminology, such as
        ‘procedures’, ‘loops’ and ‘conditional instructions’.

        Children are naturally curious and creative, and they can pick up simple coding skills (and have lots of fun!)
        through online games and tutorials.

        <h1> Learn skills that will open doors</h1>
        Computer and information technology jobs are growing incredibly fast in the United States and across the
        globe. You don't need a Computer Science degree; there are more and more high-paying
        jobs emerging every day for newer learners like you.

        <h1 align="center"> Make cool stuff</h1>
        Ever wanted to make an app or a website? Code does that. It can also help you automate a spreadsheet or create
        new tools for your community. Learning to code makes it possible to imagine
        the things you want to make and actually build them.
        <h1 align="center"> Have loads of fun</h1>
        Have you ever met a coder who regretted learning to code? Probably not, because learning to code is fun and
        empowering! Coding also opens up a whole new community and network for you.
        In fact, we've heard the term "addictive" regularly.
